Description: The survCFex package offers counterfactual explanation methods for survival analysis. It includes SurvMOC, a model-agnostic approach, and ST-PT method, specifically designed for tree-based ensemble models. These methods generate plausible and actionable counterfactuals to explain predicted survival outcomes.
