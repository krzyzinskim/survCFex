# survCFex: Counterfactual Explanations for Survival Analysis Models

The survCFex package offers counterfactual explanation methods for survival analysis models' predictions. It includes SurvMOC and ST-PT methods, model-agnostic and model-specific techniques, respectively. Both these methods ensure the time-dependent explainability.


## Installation

```R
devtools::install_github("krzyzinskim/survCFex")
```


## Author

The `survCFex` package was created by Mateusz Krzyziński as an implementation of methods proposed in MSc thesis ***Exploring predictions of machine learning survival models through counterfactual explanations***. This thesis was completed in the field of Data Science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science (MiNI), Warsaw University of Technology. The work was supervised by Przemysław Biecek, PhD, DSc.
